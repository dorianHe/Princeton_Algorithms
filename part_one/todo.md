## merge sort
I had some hard time figuring out the time complexity of merge sort (recursioin). So it would be nice to pick up the knowledge about 
time complexity and space complexity analysis of recursion based algorithms.

## mid value
When implementing merge sort, I made a mistake about splitting the array. The problem is which is correct, assuming `mid = (left + right) // 2`
* left, mid; mid + 1, right
* left, mid - 1; mid, right

## collinear points
when to use static method in a class. It is always recommended in pycharm which is annoying sometimes.

## quick sort
nuts & bolts problem remains undone.

## priority queue
implement a randomized priority queue whose method `delRandom` takes `O(logn)` time complexity.

## Assignment 8 Puzzel in priority queue
remaining undone.
